    "This book was primarily written with beginner to intermediate data scientists, data engineers, and analysts in mind, specifically those who have not yet mastered working with data sets that push the limits of a single machine. We will broadly cover all areas of a data science project from data preparation to analysis to model building with applications in Dask and take a deep dive into fundamentals of distributed computing."

    "Dask was launched in late 2014 by Matthew Rocklin with aims to bring native scalability to the Python Open Data Science Stack and overcome its single-machine restrictions. Dask consists of several different components and APIs, which can be categorized into three layers: the scheduler, low-level APIs, and high-level APIs. \n",

    "These computations are represented in code as either Dask Delayed objects or Dask Futures objects (the key difference is the former are evaluated **lazily** —meaning they are evaluated just in time when the values are needed, while the latter are evaluated **eagerly** —meaning they are evaluated in real time regardless if the value is needed immediately or not). Dask’s high-level APIs offer a layer of abstraction over Delayed and Futures objects. Operations on these high-level objects result in many parallel low-level operations managed by the task schedulers, which provides a seamless experience for the user. Because of this design, Dask brings four key advantages to the table:\n",
    "- Dask is fully implemented in Python and natively scales NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn.\n",
    "- Dask can be used effectively to work with both medium datasets on a single machine and large datasets on a cluster.\n",
    "- Dask can be used as a general framework for parallelizing most Python objects.\n",
    "- Dask has a very low configuration and maintenance overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask does a lot of the heavy lifting for common use cases, but throughout the book we’ll examine some best practices and pitfalls that will enable you to use Dask to its fullest extent."
